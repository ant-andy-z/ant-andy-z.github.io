### A Battle for the Second: T1 vs. HLE

This match, between the reigning World Champion and LCK Champion, was the spotlight of the week. It ended with a clean 2:0 win for T1 despite the turbulent process. After the match, T1 stand on 18 wins, equaling that of Hanwha Life Esports (HLE). T1 are now reclaiming their lost territories from a difficult early seaon, thanks to their new top-laner - Doran - finding synergy with his team. The 4-time domestic champion lived up to his moniker - "Domestic Doran." Earlier this season, he joined T1 after HLE gave up him for a controversial sign with T1's former 2-time World Champion - Zeus. On the other side, HLE continued to struggle after their fiascos in Road to MSI and EWC.
